# Clean Flutter Build

Helps you to clean flutter apps and lower their code size to free up some disk space.

## How to use
This script is compatible with Python3.
- Clone the repo.
- `cd` into the project folder.
- Run:
  ```sh
  python main.py /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2 /path/to/dir3
  ```

## Disclaimer
Cleaning the build won't affect your app compiled (ex: IPA and AAB) size.
