# Clean Flutter Build

Helps you to clean flutter apps and lower their code size to free up some disk space.

## How to use
This script is compatible with Python3.
- Clone the repo.
- Open the project in your favorite text editor or IDE.
- Change `apps_dir` to your flutter apps directory.
- Run terminal command `python main.py`.

## Disclaimer
Cleaning the build won't affect your app compiled (ex: IPA and AAB) size.
